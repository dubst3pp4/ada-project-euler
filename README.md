My solutions for the problems of http://project-euler.net in the programming language Ada.
==========================================================================================

This repository is for my private pleasure by learning the programming language Ada. 

- It may be helpful for you or not.
- If you have comments that help me to understand Ada or an optimization for my solutions, drop me an email.
- If you don't like Ada as a language or the way I solved the problems, ignore this repository and don't waste your time ;-)

Thanks.
